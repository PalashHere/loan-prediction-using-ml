## Overview

This project aims to streamline the **loan approval process** using supervised **Machine Learning algorithms**.  
We developed and compared multiple models to classify loan applications into *Approved* or *Denied* categories, utilizing real-world financial applicant data.

By leveraging feature engineering, model selection techniques, and evaluation metrics, we identified the best-performing model with optimized predictive power.

## Key Features

- **Data Preprocessing**: Handling categorical variables (Ordinal & One-hot Encoding) and feature scaling.
- **Feature Selection**: 
  - **Backward Elimination** and **Forward Selection** based on **AIC score**.
  - Final reduced set: **12 high-impact predictors**.
- **Models Implemented**:
  - Logistic Regression
  - Decision Tree (CART)
  - Gaussian Naive Bayes
  - K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
- **Performance Metrics**:
  - Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score, ROC-AUC
  - Confusion Matrices, Gains & Lift Charts, ROC Curves
- **Best Model**: 
  - **K-Nearest Neighbors** with **k=16**, achieving **90%+ accuracy**.

## 📊 Results Summary

| Model | Accuracy | Precision | Recall | F1-Score | ROC-AUC |
|:-----|:--------:|:---------:|:------:|:--------:|:-------:|
| KNN (k=16) | 90.4% | 86.1% | 68.0% | **76.0%** | 82.4% |
| CART | 89.7% | 82.2% | 68.9% | 74.9% | 82.3% |
| Logistic Regression | 88.7% | 76.4% | 71.8% | 74.0% | 82.7% |
| Naive Bayes | 74.9% | 47.0% | 97.9% | 63.5% | 83.1% |

**KNN model outperformed other classifiers**, offering a balanced trade-off between precision and recall.
